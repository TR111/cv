      <h2>Hello.</h2>
      <p class="intro">I am Tobias. I am participating in the crypto space since 2018, love changing the world and mainly focus on strategy as well as finance
        of the projects I work with. Currently, I focus on the development of some stealth-mode DeFi applications. In addition, I am a self-taught python as
        well as web development programmer.</p>

        <h3>Blockchain and Finance</h3>
        <img class="gif-blockchain" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/MFabj1E9mgUsqwVWHu/giphy.gif" alt="Loading-funny-gif">
        <p>After working for Airbus I studied finance at Frankfurt School and wrote my thesis about industrial DeFi applications for production companies with professor Philipp Sandner. During and after that time I supported a startup on their business development. Afterwards I started at Deloitte where I quickly realized I want more action in life. Thus, I also worked as interim CEO for 21e6, before I started my own business with two partners. We develop a fund structure as well as DeFi application for staking. In addition, I advise several companies on their development of finance departments and related issues. In our new company I also focus mainly on the financial as well as strategy part.</p>

        <p>After learning to program python last year, I started learning web development this year. For instace, I wrote this web site. The next goal is to get deeper into blockchain development as I truly believe that blockchain is the future of basically anything. In my former jobs I already worked on front-end web development (mainly with wordpress), VBA and built some small Python projects, for instance, a transcriber for my master thesis. Now, I get more sophisticated in front- and back-end development.</p>
